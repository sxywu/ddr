I came across DDR in middle school, and was immediately intrigued.  It was the first time I had begged my parents for a video game, and the only time my parents bought me one.  I played all through high school with my friends and my little sister, and it is a part of some of my fondest memories.  So when I found <a href='http://www.ddrfreak.com/' target='_new'>DDR Freak</a> while looking for DDR data, I was beyond ecstatic; when I found their <a href='http://www.ddrfreak.com/stepcharts/stepcharts.php' target='_new'>step charts</a>, I knew I had to visualize them.

At 250 songs, each with different modes (Single, Double, 6Panel, etc.) and difficulty levels (Basic, Trick, Maniac), thatÊ¼s a lot of data; I had to be selective with what I showed.  Thus, each song only shows steps from Single mode, and only shows both arrows (jumps) when expanded.  IÊ¼ve also compressed each song as much as possible, so that you can compare multiple songs at a time.  I hope that you find fascinating patterns, and if at first you donÊ¼t, try filtering by a difficulty level.
